Mempoolio – An NFT Project That Doesn’t Take Itself Too Seriously

Welcome to Mempoolio, a parody NFT experiment where internet culture, pixel art, and questionable life choices collide.
This repository contains a React-based website and a tiny Express server that together power a tongue‑in‑cheek collection of “Mempoolio” characters.
